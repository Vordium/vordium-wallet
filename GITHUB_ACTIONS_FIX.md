# üîß GitHub Actions Fix - Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/vordium-wallet/vordium-wallet. 
Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock
```

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) was configured with:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'  # ‚ùå This requires package-lock.json
```

The `cache: 'npm'` option requires a lock file to exist, but we hadn't generated one yet.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    # Removed cache line until package-lock.json is added
```

Also changed:
- `npm ci` ‚Üí `npm install` (since npm ci requires lock file)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
- GitHub Actions will no longer fail on setup-node step
- Workflow can now install dependencies

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Behavior
The CI workflow **may still show warnings** because:
1. The repository doesn't have all source code yet (it's in artifacts)
2. Build might fail at the `npm run build` step
3. This is **normal and expected** for the current state

### What This Means
- ‚úÖ No more lock file errors
- ‚úÖ Workflow can run
- ‚è≥ Build will succeed once full source code is added
- ‚úÖ **Vercel deployment is NOT affected** (Vercel handles this differently)

## For Future: Generate Lock File

When you're ready to add the full source code, generate a lock file:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Vordium/vordium-wallet.git
cd vordium-wallet

# Install dependencies (generates package-lock.json)
npm install

# Commit the lock file
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add package-lock.json for dependency locking"
git push
```

Then update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to re-enable caching:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'  # Re-enable after lock file exists
```

## Vercel Deployment Status

**Important:** This GitHub Actions issue **does NOT affect Vercel deployment**!

- ‚úÖ Vercel has its own build system
- ‚úÖ Vercel will handle dependencies automatically
- ‚úÖ Your app **can deploy to Vercel right now**

## Summary

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| GitHub Actions Error | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Can Deploy to Vercel | ‚úÖ Yes |
| CI Workflow Runs | ‚úÖ Yes |
| CI Build Success | ‚è≥ After source code added |
| Lock File | ‚è≥ Optional (for later) |

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel** - Not blocked by this issue
2. **Add source code** - When ready (from artifacts)
3. **Generate lock file** - Recommended for production
4. **Re-enable caching** - After lock file exists

---

**Issue Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

The GitHub Actions will no longer fail on the dependency lock file check.
